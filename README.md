<p>My final project for the FNEL 141 class was making a board game that would allow for a fun
and engaging learning experience for players. The final product includes a cardboard playboard
decorated to reflect the theme of the game, a rulebook/manual, answer and translation guide,
various tokens, and the action cards.</p>

<p>The intended audience is young and/or new Kwak’wala learners; however, I hope that the people
from different language level groups can still enjoy it and hopefully learn something new. The
game’s content would require the players to already have a basic understanding of Kwak’wala
grammar and sentence structure, as well as some easy everyday vocabulary.</p>
